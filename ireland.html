            <p class="flu-top">At about 10.45 on Saturday night, a collision occurred on the R183 Newbliss Road near Clonavilla in Clones.</p>
            
            <p class="flu-bottom">At the site, the pedestrian's death was confirmed.

                No other injuries were reported, according to Garda.
                
                Local detours are in place as forensic collision investigators conduct an examination of the R183 at Clonavilla, which has been shut down.
                
                Police are requesting witnesses.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="flu-bottom">Anybody who was driving on the R183 Newbliss Road between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. and has video, especially dashcam video, is requested to report it to garda.

                Anybody with information is urged to call the Garda Confidential Line at 1800 666 111, the Monaghan Garda Station at (047) 77200, or any Garda station.</p>

            <p class="flu-bottom">The flight, which is planned to build on the successful unmanned Artemis I mission finished in December, will prepare the way for future long-term human exploration missions to the Moon and eventually Mars. It will also place the first woman and first person of color on the Moon through the Artemis program. This is the agency's plan for exploring Mars and the Moon.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="flu-bottom">"These people, the crew of the Artemis II, will be the first humans to fly to the Moon's vicinity in more than 50 years. The crew includes the first woman, first person of color, and first Canadian to travel to the moon. According to Director Vanessa Wyche of NASA Johnson, "These four astronauts will symbolize the finest of humanity as they explore for the benefit of all. The Artemis Generation, economic, industrial, and academic relationships, as well as the development of human deep space travel, are all made possible by this mission.</p>

            <p class="flu-bottom">The mission will be Glover’s second spaceflight, serving previously as pilot on NASA’s SpaceX Crew-1, which landed May 2, 2021, after 168 days in space. As a flight engineer aboard the space station for Expedition 64, he contributed to scientific investigations, technology demonstrations, and participated in four spacewalks.</p>

            <p class="flu-bottom">Representing Canada, Hansen is making his first flight to space. A colonel in the Canadian Armed Forces and former fighter pilot, Hansen holds a Bachelor of Science in space science from Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston, Ontario, and a Master of Science in physics from the same institution in 2000, with a research focus on Wide Field of View Satellite Tracking. He was one of two recruits selected by CSA in May 2009 through the third Canadian Astronaut Recruitment Campaign and has served as Capcom in NASA's Mission Control Center at Johnson and, in 2017, became the first Canadian to be entrusted with leading a NASA astronaut class, leading the training of astronaut candidates from the United States and Canada.</p>
