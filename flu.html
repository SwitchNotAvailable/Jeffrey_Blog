            <p>Last year, thousands of gannets died due to the H5N1 virus, prompting Professor Ian Brown, who serves as the Director of Scientific Services at the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency, to emphasize the importance of being vigilant.</p>

        <div class="flu-text">
            <p class="flu-top">As large numbers of seabirds return to the UK coast for the nesting season, scientists are on high alert for a potential new outbreak of bird flu. </p>
            
            <p class="flu-bottom"> This could have a devastating impact on the population of gannets and other species, with a risk of the virus being transmitted to mammals as well. Professor Ian Brown, the Director of Scientific Services at the government's Animal and Plant Health Agency (APHA), expressed concern in an exclusive interview with Sky News that the source of last year's H5N1 virus remains unclear.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="flu-bottom">It is believed that the virus may have been introduced into seabird colonies by other bird populations, particularly gulls, which are highly susceptible to the virus and can carry and spread it within a colony. The virus can spread rapidly within tightly packed colonies, leading to thousands of seabird deaths, as seen last year.</p>
            <br>
            
            <p class="flu-bottom">Gannets, guillemots, puffins, and kittiwakes have begun congregating in large numbers on steep cliffs to raise their young after spending the winter out at sea. "We hope that the birds will return and have a successful breeding season while being shielded from any viruses," stated Professor Brown. However, in light of last summer's events, we must be more vigilant and on the lookout for early signs that the virus has returned."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="flu-bottom">The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) has volunteers and wardens who are inspecting colonies for sick birds and scanning the sea surface for any that have perished. Bempton Cliffs nature reserve on the Yorkshire coast houses half a million seabirds, with so many gannets that the location is of international importance for the species. Unfortunately, in the most densely populated sections of the colony, 80% of gannet chicks perished last year.</p>

        <br>

        <div class="flu-text">
            <p class="flu-bottom">According to Dave O'Hara, the senior site manager for RSPB, it's highly likely that the gannet chicks perished due to starvation, possibly because one or both of their adult parents died. He expressed concern regarding the death of adult birds since they only produce one offspring per year, and it may take an extended period for the population to rebound. This year, there is heightened apprehension about potential threats.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="flu-bottom">The H5N1 virus was initially identified in 1996 and was typically responsible for minor outbreaks in domestic poultry and migrating ducks and geese until two years ago.</p>
